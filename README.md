SigmaSim is a satirical life sim and financial incremental game where you claw your way from broke beta to sigma übermensch, all inside a virtual desktop environment.
Click, scheme, and optimize your way to the top—or die grinding.

This is an early prototype, using placeholder art and rough or incomplete implementation of game systems.
